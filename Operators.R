# Operators perform operations on variables and values.

# There are 5 types of operators.#

# - Arithmetric (e.g.: +, -, *, /, ^ %% (modulus), %/% (integer division))

# - Assignment (e.g.: <-, <<-, ->, ->>)

# - Comparison (e.g.: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

# - Logical (see examples below)
# - -  &  (element-wise logical AND operator)
# - -  && (logical AND operator)
# - -  |  (element-wise logical OR operator)
# - -  || (logical OR operator)
# - -  !  (logical NOT)
# - NOTE: element-wise operators are used to compare two logical vectors element by element and returns a new logical vector with the outcome (TRUE or FALSE) depending on the operation

# - Miscellaneous (see examples below)
# - - :    creates a series of numbers in a sequence
# - - %in% finds out if an element belongs to a vector
# - - %*%  matrix multiplication
